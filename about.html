    <h1>Integration of Screens Into Shanghai's Urban Landscape</h1>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      The city of Shanghai has become infamous for its rapid development into a modern city, turning agriculture wastelands into a financial district within two decades. Shanghai’s obsession with media facade has created a unique urban landscape with entire buildings faces functioning as large screens. In understanding how the current urban landscape was developed and shaped can be beneficial in predicting Shanghai’s future urban landscape and if Shanghai is in danger of shifting into a ‘Generic City’. A generic city has no history or identity, it is completely free of context.

      <h3>The Project</h3>
        The purpose of this project is to showcase how Shanghai may look in the future in which screens have only continuously been integrated into the landscape. The photos were taken with 360 degree camera, in which hyper-reality images where then edited into the image. User's have the ability to interact with the 360 degree photos and explore the different aspects of the hyper-reality.
